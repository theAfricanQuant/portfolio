# Portfolio

## [- Bayesian Statistics: Analysis of Health Data](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/bayesian-statistics-health-data/)

Here is an example of how Bayesian statistics can be used to indicate the best predictor of BMI fluctuations within a regression model.


## [- Cumulative Binomial Probability with R and Shiny](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/cumulative-binomial-probability-r-shiny/)

The following is an illustration of how cumulative binomial probability can be calculated, and how a Shiny Web App can be used to make the analysis more intuitive.

## [- Deploying Python application using Docker and AWS](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/docker-aws/)

In this example, we will see how a simple Python script can be incorporated into a Docker image, and this image will then be pushed to ECR (Elastic Container Registry) in AWS.

## [- Image Recognition with Keras: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/image-recognition-with-keras-convolutional-neural-networks/)

An example of how the VGG16 neural network can be used to classify images. In this instance, road vehicles are classified using ImageNet as a training source, and image manipulation methods with PIL are explored.


## [- Kalman Filter: Modelling Time Series Shocks with KFAS in R](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/kalman-filter-shocks-kfas/)

A common problem in modelling a time series is the presence of "shocks", or extreme outliers in the series. Here is an illustration of how a Kalman Filter can help model for the same.


## [- Modelling time series relationships between the S&P 500 and oil prices](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/time-series-relationships-economics/)

In this example, an OLS regression model is constructed in an attempt to forecast future S&P 500 levels based on the price of Brent crude oil.


## [- neuralnet: Train and Test Neural Networks Using R](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/neural-network-modelling-neuralnet-r/)

Examples of how **classification** and **regression** problems can be solved using neuralnet.


## [- Predicting Hotel Cancellations with ExtraTreesClassifier and Support Vector Machines](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/hotel-cancellations/)

Here is an example of how the ExtraTreesClassifier and support vector machines can be used in Python to determine whether a potential customer will cancel their hotel booking or not.


## [- Predicting Irish electricity consumption with an LSTM neural network](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/electricity-consumption-neural/)

An LSTM model is used to forecast energy consumption of the Dublin City Council Civic Offices using data between April 2011 â€“ February 2013.


## [- Summarizing Economic Bulletin Documents with tf-idf](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/nlp-economics/)

In this example, a selection of economic bulletins in PDF format from 2018 to 2019 are analysed in order to gauge economic sentiment. The bulletins in question are sourced from the European Central Bank website. tf-idf is used to rank words in a particular order of importance, and then a word cloud is used as a visual to highlight key words in the text.


## [- Visualizing New York City WiFi Access with K-Means Clustering](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/visualizing-new-york-city-wifi-access-with-k-means-clustering/)

A k-means clustering algorithm is used to analyse geographical data for free public WiFi in New York City, and the clusters are mapped geographically using **nycmaps**.


## [- Working with panel data in R: Fixed vs. Random Effects (plm)](https://mgcodesandstats.github.io/panel-data-plm-r/)

Here is an analysis of internet usage across both time and consumers (i.e. a panel dataset) using the **plm** library in R.
